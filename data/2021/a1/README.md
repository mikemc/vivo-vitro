# Data from sequencing center A1 (Michigan)

## Source data from U. of Michigan's Microbiome Core

The sequence data was transfered to MMs Illumina BaseSpace account, from which MM downloaded it using Illumina's `bs` command line tool.

The Excel spreadsheet 'workbook' was provided to MM by email and contains experimental methods, sample submission info, DNA concentration measurements, and other run and QC information.

## Within this folder

The raw fastq reads are within this folder in reads/raw.
The original Excel workbook file in this folder is used downstream for DNA concentration measurements.

## Backups

The source data files are backed up in MM's sequence-data backup drive in folder /data/vivo-vitro/2021/a1 and in MM's Illumina BaseSpace account.
