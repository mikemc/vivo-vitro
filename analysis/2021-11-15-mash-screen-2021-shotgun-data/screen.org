#+TITLE: Screen the 2021 shotgun data
This file applies the Mash Screen analysis from analysis/2020-07-16-mash/screen.org to the new shotgun sequencing data, in order to confirm that the strains are the same and assess whether there are notable new contaminants.

* Setup
#+PROPERTY: header-args:shell :eval never-export
#+PROPERTY: header-args:R :results value :colnames yes :exports both :eval never-export

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent
;; Increase text width
(setq visual-fill-column-width 100)
;; Default inline image width
(setq org-image-actual-width (list 800))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :session mash :results silent
msh_file=/home/michael/data/mash/refseq.genomes.k21s1000.msh
mkdir output
#+END_SRC
* Do stuff

Previously, I just used the S2 data, and I picked the 8 files corresponding to 4 fecal samples, and the 8 files corresponding to 4 inoculum samples.
I ran Mash Screen with and without the '-w' option.

instead of picking a subset of samples, perhaps we can subsample from all files?
Or just screen everything (all fecal, and all mock samples)

might be easier to work within Rmd rather than org mode
